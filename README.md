# Natural-Language-Processing-MySQL
Performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), or document clustering solely within MySQL using SQL queries or stored procedures is quite challenging due to the complexity and the need for specialized NLP libraries and algorithms that MySQL doesn't inherently support.
For more advanced NLP tasks, you would typically use dedicated NLP libraries in programming languages like Python or specialized NLP platforms (such as Google Cloud NLP, IBM Watson, or Microsoft Azure Text Analytics) to perform these tasks and then store the analyzed results in a MySQL database for further querying and analysis based on the processed data.
